Kind reminder for Steam player: Remember to save your modded <br> folder before Innersloth updates their game.
Beware! When Innersloth will update, Epic player won't be able to play <br> the mod until our team fixed it!
Have a nice start into the week! :)
If you're a developer and interested to be part of the TOR team <br> Check out our Discord!
